# Movie Data Processing

## 📄 Description

This sprint focuses on developing functions to manage and analyze a dataset of movies, including tasks like extracting director data, calculating average ratings, and sorting movies. The project emphasizes the practice of essential JavaScript methods such as `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`, as well as creating unit tests to verify functionality.

### Objectives

- Practice using array methods like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`.
- Learn to create unit tests.
- Manipulate a dataset for targeted information extraction.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Jest.js (for testing)

<br>

## 📋 Requirements

- **JavaScript ES6** or higher
- **Jest.js** for running unit tests

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository: 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dracudev/S3-Testing-JS.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
  ```bash

## ▶️ Execution

1. Run the tests to validate functionality. This will automatically generate a test-results.html file showing test outcomes.
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run test:watch
  ```

2. Open test-results.html in a browser (recommended to use the Live Server plugin in Visual Studio Code for auto-refresh).
